### Bank Customer Churn Prediction 

This is my final project for the MLOps ZoomCamp. The goal is to build an end-to-end machine learning project applying all the tools and concepts seen in the course. 

## Problem Description

The objective of this project is to predict whether a bank customer is likely to change provider or not. Churn is rather costly for any company, and Machine Learning can help identifying potential quitters before they leave, allowing the bank to act on it in advance. 

### Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about bank customers, and can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radheshyamkollipara/bank-customer-churn). For more information related to the dataset, you can consult the [data dictionary]().
